# Third-Capstone

## Overview

The goal of this project is to see how Bitcoin price movements affect the prices of the next two largest cryptocurrencies by market cap. 

## Data Wrangling

Data for this project was pulled from Kraken Digital Asset Exchange. There is a third-party Python library that uses the Kraken API to pull data and is formatted as a Pandas dataframe with the date-time as an index. This is a very user-friendly API in that no adjustments have to be done to the data to get it into the proper format. 

All the code for the API data pull and additionally data wrangling can be seen here:
